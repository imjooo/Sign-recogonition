# Sign-recogonition
Inability to speak is true disability. Speech impairment is a disability that affects an
individualâ€™s ability to communicate using speech and hearing. Mode of communication such
as sign language is used by people affected by this impairment. There exists a challenge for
non-signers to communicate with signers although the sign language is ubiquitous in recent
times. There has been a strong progress in the fields of motion and recognition of gestures
with the recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning techniques. The major
focus of this work is to create a deep learning-based application that offers sign language
translation to text thereby aiding communication between signers and non-signers. We use a
custom CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for recognizing the sign from a video frame.
MNIST dataset is used.
